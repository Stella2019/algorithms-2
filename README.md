Some python snippets for the Algorithms Part 2 online course of Tim Roughgarden from Stanford University

Besides doing the algorithms course I'm also learning python so even if the snippets do solve 
the requested assigments there is probably many improvements on efficiency..

Feel free to comment or PR if you have improvements that help making this code more efficient.
